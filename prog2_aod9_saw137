   File: prog2_aod9_saw137.cpp

   Author: Andrew Daly & Samuel Wienecke
   C.S.1428.001
   Lab Section: L08 & L01
   Program: #2
   Due Date: 10/02/19

   This program prompts the user to enter the amount of a purchase (in cents).
   It then prompts the user to enter the amount received in payment (in cents).
   It calculates the amount of change due, printing the results to an output
   file. The author's identifying information is provided followed by the
   number of each coin to be given in change: the number of dollars, half
   dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies are listed in tabular form.
   Monetary amounts are displayed to two decimal places.

   An appropriate message is displayed to the console screen if the output
   file fails to open.

   An appropriate message is written to the console screen informing the
   user of the output file name to which the results have been written.
   The layout and content of the file output are shown in the sample below.

   Input (keyboard):
          purchase amount, integer (in cents)
          payment amount, integer (in cents)

   Constants: none

   Output (screen):
